## Backgammon
This project implements a dynamic user interface with interesting layouts and a variety of game options such as sounds, showing legal moves, single/double player, statistics and more. Single player mode is where the magic happens. The AI is capable of moving the mouse cursor on his turn, and makes all the right moves. This movement is based on scoring all the possible moves and choosing the highest score as the optimal move. The AI tries to make progress at the same time as not letting the human win the game.
